## Current Features:
- Multiple profiles to save bookmark lists
- Smart random page selector (avoids repetition)
- Go to specific bookmark by index
- Buttons to go to next and previous bookmark

## Todo:
- UI to re-order bookmarks
- Custom profile names
- Ability to favorite specific sites to make them appear first

### Might be implemented:
- Website change detection, and priority

Bookmark profiles are stored in `Other Bookmarks/Website Feed/`
